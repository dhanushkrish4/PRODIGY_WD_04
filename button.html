        When designing a personal portfolio website, it's important to focus on both visual appeal and user experience. Here are some key web design details to consider for a clean and professional layout:

1. Layout and Structure
Navigation Bar: Simple and fixed at the top, with links to different sections (Home, About, Projects, Contact).
<br>Grid Layout: Use a grid layout for the projects section to display items neatly. It helps in organizing content and makes the design look clean.<br>
<br>Sections: Divide the webpage into clearly defined sections:
<br>Home (Introduction): A welcoming headline and brief introduction with a call-to-action (CTA) button.
<br>About Me: A section for background information, skills, and a professional photo.
<br>Projects: Showcase your projects in a visually organized way, with descriptions and links.
<br>Contact: Include a contact form or social links in the footer.<br>
<br>2. Typography
<br>Font Choices: Use modern, easy-to-read fonts like "Roboto," "Open Sans," or "Lato" for body text and headings. Stick to no more than two different font families.
<br>Font Sizes: Make headings large and bold to capture attention (e.g., 3rem for the main heading, 2rem for section titles), and use smaller but legible font sizes (e.g., 1rem) for paragraphs.
<br>Line Height: Ensure there is enough space between lines (1.5–1.8) to improve readability.<br>
<br>3. Color Scheme
<br>Primary Colors: Choose 2–3 primary colors that align with your personal brand. A common choice is a combination of dark blue or black for text, and a highlight color like teal, orange, or purple for buttons and links.
<br>Background Color: A clean, white or light gray background makes text and images stand out. You can also use subtle gradients to add depth.
<br>Contrast: Ensure there is good contrast between text and background colors to improve readability, especially for important elements like headings and buttons.
<br>4. Imagery and Icons<br>
<br>Professional Photo: Include a high-quality photo of yourself in the "About Me" section. It should be a professional headshot that represents your personal brand.
<br>Project Thumbnails: Use clean, high-resolution images for each project. The images should be consistent in size and style.
<br>Icons: Use icons for skills or social links (e.g., GitHub, LinkedIn). Icons should be simple and match the overall style of the website.
<br>5. Call to Action (CTA) Buttons<br>
<br>Button Design: Make buttons prominent by using your highlight color, rounded corners, and clear, action-oriented text (e.g., "View My Work," "Contact Me").
<br>Hover Effects: Add subtle hover effects to buttons (e.g., a change in background color or slight scaling) to make interactions more engaging.
<br>6. Responsive Design
<br>Mobile First: Design with mobile users in mind, using responsive breakpoints (media queries) for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
<br>Navigation: For smaller screens, use a hamburger menu.
<br>Flexbox/Grid: Use CSS Flexbox or Grid for responsive layouts that automatically adjust content based on screen size.
<br>Image Scaling: Ensure images and fonts resize appropriately on smaller devices.
<br>7. Whitespace and Spacing
<br>Use of Whitespace: Don't overcrowd elements. Whitespace (empty space between elements) helps keep the design clean and allows the content to "breathe."
<br>Padding and Margins: Add sufficient padding around sections and margins between elements to maintain a balanced layout.
<br>8. Animation and Interaction
**Smooth Scrolling
